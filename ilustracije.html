          <p>Ovdje ćemo ilustrirati neke probleme koje zahvaćaju moderno društvo. Nećemo ulaziti u teoriju niti detalje, već ćemp jednostavno postavljati pitanja kako bismo na elementarnoj razini uočili problem i potencijalan apsurd koji ga okružuje.

	      <p>the relationships in renting. A landlord owns the complex, the renters have to give them money to stay there. Call into question why a landlord is necessary when everyone living in the complex likely has the expertise to manage the complex from the position of a council. One could even argue that on some level, it's even more ethical to be able to VOTE for your complex manager to use the functions of a landlord purely for the tasks of maintaining the building while using the collected rent to strictly pay off the taxes and maintenance of said building. In this case, the responsibility and ownership of the building should be squarely on the shoulders of those who are occupying the building.

The landlord... through implicit use of state violence is granted authority to extract rent from tenants; the worst case scenario being that if one doesn't pay rent, they are forcefully evicted. Why can't the actual tenants of the building wield this privilege themselves instead of someone who is collecting rent for the sake of profit and expanding their own real estate investments. The point... is that even in the absence of landlords, the demand for homes does not go away. Therefore, communities would obviously create their own institutions of establishing homes from the ground up instead of through landlordism which is essentially the same thing for single individuals through a state grant without any accountability to them except for their own profit and bottom line.</p>
